## Hello! I'm Fabian ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer from Hong Kong. I graduated from [HKUST](https://www.ust.hk/) majored in Computer Science.

I started off teaching myself design and web development. And I was fortunate that JavaScript frameworks started to take over the Internet and I'm able to extend my skills to full stack development! I'm currently working at [SoFi HK](https://www.sofi.hk/) where we develop an easy-to-use mobile investment platform for everyone. I also like to share my knowledge and help people grow. This is one of the reason why I started blogging.

I'm not the most logical engineer you'll meet. But I'm proud to be someone that sees the world in a humanistic perspective. This helps me understand people better and build products with seamless and aesthetically pleasing user experience.
