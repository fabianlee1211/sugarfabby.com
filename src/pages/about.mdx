## Hello! I'm Fabian ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer from Hong Kong. I graduated from [HKUST](https://www.ust.hk/) with a Bachelor degree in Computer Science. School unfortunately didn't inspire me to code and build softwares instead it's the time I spent in self-learning and having fun.

I started off with design and web development. And I was fortunate that JavaScript frameworks started to blow up and I'm able to extend my skills to full stack development! Currently, I'm a dev at [SoFi HK](https://www.sofi.hk/) where we develop an easy-to-use mobile investment platform. And I'm focusing on React, React Native, Node, GraphQL, Jest and Gatsby.

I'm not the most logical engineer you'll meet. But I'm proud to be someone that sees the world in a humanistic perspective. This helps us understand and build meaningful relationship all other living beings.
